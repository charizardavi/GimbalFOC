# GimbalFOC
A gimbal BLDC controller that uses an ATMega328p with a DRV8313PWPR. Communicates over SoftwareSerial with a parent microcontroller such as an Arduino.

## Other Parts
- BLDC (there's a bunch that will work): https://shop.iflight.com/gimbal-motors-cat44/ipower-motor-gm6208-150t-brushless-gimbal-motor-pro208
- Battery: Any 4-5S LiPO with an XT60 connector

## Completed
- Initial schema
- Intial footprint sourcing

## TODO
- Find capacitor and resistor manufacturers
- Layout PCB
- find digikey sources for JLC parts, or replace parts, to assemble by hand rather than with PCBA service (partially done)
